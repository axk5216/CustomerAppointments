Customer Appointments Assignment - C950 WGU

C950 Project - WGU

Customers and appointments are linked together via foreign keys in a MySQL database.  Program offers functionality to add, update, or remove customers and appointments.
Also utilizes UTC->EST conversions in order to populate time selector due to business operating hours constraints.  Checks time against database to ensure new apopintments or 
modified appointments fit constraints.  Includes error checking and form validation.

When an appointment or customer is modified or created, modification occurs in the instantiated class object in addition to the MySQL database.

Overall, this course required higher-level development practices as well as many other constraints and was a challenging project to complete.

This is one of the final projects to complete in order to graduate.
